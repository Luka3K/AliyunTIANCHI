open-sourced procedures of joining ML competions on Aliyun TIANCHI

1. The first project is about the financial risk control -- Loans Default Forecast
I started this project on 15/09/2020, and I hope to learn something useful.

15/09/2020
Stopped at missing values.

16/09/2020
Finished reading the first 2 official guiding chapters.
Still need to review and try to memorize and use more.

18/09/2020
Finished feature engineering (chap 3).
Have to review all the knowledge after finishing reading this project guide.

20/09/2020
Forgot to read carefully, so the 4th chap needs to conduct feature engineering according to baseline.
Must finish this chap tomorrow.
And I think this procedure needs to be ignored, because there is no 'sample', and I can just choose a certain/easy way to complete feature engineering, because my purpose in this chap is to realize model constrcution and parameter adjustment after all.

22/09/2020
Yesterday, I finished chap4 and I completed the whole procedure today, but I didn't output the result file because I still want to conduct Xgboost which has cost so much time and forced me to give it up tonight. Maybe I can try to output tomorrow and review this project.
So there are still some problems remained. First, how to adjust parameters in the model? Second, what's the logic and intuition of the model? Third, need to learn the details in feature engineering.
